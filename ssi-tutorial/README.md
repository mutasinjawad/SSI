> 💫 **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** is a digital identity model that allows individuals to own, control, and share their personal information without relying on a central authority. In SSI, users can create and manage their identities using decentralized technologies, such as blockchain, which enhances privacy, security, and user autonomy.

## 🔑 Key Concepts of SSI

<div align="center">

| Concept                                                     | Traditional Way                                                                              | SSI Way                                                           | Benefits                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🎯 Decentralization** <br> _"You're in Control"_          | Need Facebook/Google accounts to log into websites. Companies control your digital identity. | You control your own digital identity, like your physical wallet. | • No dependency on companies <br> • Full control over your identity <br> • Single identity for all services                  |
| **📜 Verifiable Credentials** <br> _"Digital Certificates"_ | Physical certificates and ID cards in your wallet.                                           | Digital versions of certificates that can't be forged.            | • Can't be faked or altered <br> • Instant sharing <br> • Selective disclosure <br> • Digital signatures from issuers        |
| **🆔 DIDs** <br> _"Your Digital Identity Number"_           | Email address or phone number owned by companies.                                            | Your own unique digital ID that belongs only to you.              | • You own it completely <br> • Not controlled by companies <br> • Can't be taken away <br> • Permanent digital address       |
| **💼 Wallets** <br> _"Your Digital Identity Vault"_         | Physical wallet with ID cards, certificates, and licenses.                                   | Secure app storing digital credentials.                           | • Digital storage of IDs <br> • Enhanced security <br> • Selective sharing <br> • User control                               |
| **🤝 Trust triangle** <br> _"The Circle of Trust"_          | Trust based on physical documents issued by authorities.                                     | Digital credentials verified instantly through cryptography.      | • Instant verification <br> • Cryptographically secure <br> • No need to contact issuer <br> • Selective information sharing |

## 🔄 The Trust Triangle

![Trust-Triangle](demo/credo/assets/SSI-Trust-Triangle.jpg)

<br>

> 🤝 The Trust Triangle is a foundational concept in Self-Sovereign Identity that illustrates the relationships between the three key parties involved in identity verification:

<br>

### Key Participants

<div style="padding: 20px;">

1. 🏛️ **The Issuer**
   > The trusted authority that issues verifiable credentials to the holder. This could be an educational institution, government agency, or any organization that can validate the information.

<br>

2. 👤 **The Holder**
   > The individual or entity that owns the identity and holds the credentials. They have full control over their personal information and can choose what to share.

<br>

3. ✅ **The Verifier**
   > The party that needs to verify the holder's credentials. This could be a service provider, employer, or any entity that requires proof of identity or qualifications.

</div>

<div style="background-color: #f6f8fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 6px; margin: 20px 0;">

💫 **Key Insight**: The Trust Triangle emphasizes that trust is established through the relationships between these three parties, allowing for secure and private interactions without the need for a central authority.

</div>

<br>

## 💡 How SSI Works in Real Life

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

### 1. 🏛️ Issuer

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #007bff; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">
Think of this as a university, government, or any organization that issues official documents
</div>

#### What They Do:

- Creates official digital documents (like a digital version of your degree)
- Ensures each document follows a standard format
- Adds their official digital signature
- Makes sure their documents can be verified by others

#### Real-Life Example:

> Just like a university issues paper degrees, in SSI they:

- Create digital degrees that can't be forged
- Include all necessary information (grades, date, major)
- Sign it digitally (like a traditional university seal)

</div>

<br>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

### 2. 👤 Holder (You)

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #28a745; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">
This is you - the person who receives and owns the credentials
</div>

#### What You Can Do:

- Have a digital wallet on your phone (like Apple Wallet, but for your ID documents)
- Receive official documents from organizations
- Store them securely in your digital wallet
- Share only what you want, when you want

#### Real-Life Example:

> Just like your physical wallet, but better:

- Store your university degree, driver's license, and certificates digitally
- Choose what to share (show age without revealing address)
- No risk of losing physical documents

</div>

<br>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

### 3. ✅ Verifier (The Checker)

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #dc3545; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">
Think of this as an employer or any organization that needs to verify your credentials
</div>

#### What They Do:

- Ask for specific information they need
- Verify your digital documents instantly
- Trust the documents without calling the issuer
- Only see what you choose to share

#### Real-Life Example:

> When applying for a job:

- Employer asks for proof of degree
- You share just the relevant details from your digital degree
- They can verify it's real instantly
- No need to call the university to check

</div>

## ⚙️ Technical Workflow of SSI Entities

![technical-work-flow](demo/credo/assets/technical-work-flow.png)

### 🔧 Initial Setup

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

1. 🆔 **DID Creation and Registration**
   <div style="border-left: 4px solid #007bff; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">

   - Issuer creates and registers institutional DID on ledger
   - Holder creates personal DID for identity management
   - Verifier establishes organizational DID for verification purposes
   </div>

2. 📋 **Schema Registration (by Issuer)**
   <div style="border-left: 4px solid #28a745; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">

   - A schema defines the structure of the credentials that can be issued. It includes attributes such as name, version, and the specific data fields that will be included in the credential.
   - Issuer registers schema on the ledger
   - Example attributes: `name`, `date`, `degree_type`, `institution`
   </div>

3. 📝 **Credential Definition Setup (by Issuer)**
   <div style="border-left: 4px solid #dc3545; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">
   
   - A credential definition links a schema to a specific credential type and includes additional metadata, such as the issuer's DID and the credential's unique identifier. This allows for the creation of verifiable credentials based on the registered schema.
   - Issuer publishes credential definition to ledger.
   </div>
</div>

### 🔄 Credential Issuance and Verification

   </div>

#### C. ✅ Verification Flow

1. **Proof Request**
   <div style="border-left: 4px solid #20c997; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">

   - Verifier sends proof request
   - Specifies required attributes
   - Defines predicates (if any)
   </div>

2. **Proof Generation**
   <div style="border-left: 4px solid #e83e8c; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">

   - Holder receives proof request
   - Selects appropriate credentials
   - Generates zero-knowledge proofs
   - Creates proof presentation
   </div>

3. **Verification Process**
   <div style="border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">
   
   - Verifier receives proof presentation
   - Validates cryptographic signatures
   - Checks revocation status
   - Verifies credential claims
   </div>
</div>

</div>


### 🧪 Testing the Setup

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #28a745; padding-left: 20px; margin: 15px 0;">

#### 1. 🔗 Create Connection

- Generate invitation from issuer interface
- Scan the generated QR code by Bifold wallet (Holder's wallet)

#### 2. 📜 Issue Credential

- Issuer will send a credential offer to your connected wallet (Bifold wallet)

#### 3. ✅ Accept Credential

- Open the credential offer and accept credential from the wallet

#### 4. 🔍 Verify Credential
- An issuer also can act as a verifier. Because sometimes issuer needs to verify your issued credential.
- In this setup, issuer will send you a credential proof request after credential issuance.
- Share your credential in the proof request.

Or, if you want to use different verifier:
- Generate invitation from verifier agent
- Scan the generated QR code by Bifold wallet (Holder's wallet)
- Send proof request to the holder
- Share proof from the Bifold wallet
- Verify received proof
